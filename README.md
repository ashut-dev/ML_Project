# Black-Box Optimisation (BBO) Capstone Project

This repository contains my final submission for the Black-Box Optimisation (BBO) capstone project.  
The project spans **13 iterative query rounds**, each aligned with weekly learning objectives across optimisation, machine learning, deep learning, interpretability and unsupervised learning.

The central objective is to maximise **eight unknown black-box functions** (ranging from 2D to 8D) under a strict query budget of **one query per function per round**.  
All optimisation decisions are made without access to gradients or internal function structure, reflecting real-world black-box constraints.

This submission emphasises **process, reasoning and learning progression**, not just final performance.

## 1. Project Objective

The BBO capstone aims to:

- Efficiently explore and exploit unknown objective functions  
- Adapt optimisation strategy as more data becomes available  
- Demonstrate how theoretical ML concepts translate into practical decision-making under uncertainty  

Each round represents a **deliberate optimisation decision informed by newly learned methods**, rather than a fixed optimiser applied repeatedly.

## 2. Learning-Driven Iterative Strategy

The optimisation strategy evolves week-by-week, directly reflecting the programme’s curriculum.

| Round | Learning Focus |
|------|---------------|
| 01 | Bayesian Optimisation (uncertainty-aware exploration) |
| 02 | Logistic Regression (good vs bad region separation) |
| 03 | Support Vector Machines (decision boundary reasoning) |
| 04 | Neural Networks (non-linear surrogate modelling) |
| 05 | Advanced Neural Networks (backpropagation, gradients) |
| 06 | CNN analogy (coarse-to-fine refinement) |
| 07 | Hyperparameter sensitivity |
| 08 | Hyperparameter tuning strategies |
| 09 | GenAI & prompt structuring |
| 10 | Advanced GenAI (decoding, hallucination control) |
| 11 | Transparency & interpretability |
| 12 | Unsupervised learning – Clustering |
| 13 | Unsupervised learning – PCA |

Each round produces **exactly one portal-ready query per function**, submitted and evaluated before proceeding to the next iteration.
